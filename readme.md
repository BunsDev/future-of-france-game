## Overview

**The Future of France** is an innovative blockchain learning game designed to introduce new users to the world of Web3. This project combines elements of education and entertainment to create an engaging experience that helps players understand and navigate blockchain technology safely and effectively.

## Key Features

### Gamified Learning Experience
Players start in a military lab, progressing through seven training levels that cover essential Web3 skills, such as:
- Connecting wallets to websites
- Signing transactions
- Using addresses and obtaining test ETH
- Minting and sending tokens
- Making VRF requests and minting NFTs

## NPC Integration with ChatGPTo

### Dynamic Interactions
In **The Future of France**, players interact with a variety of NPCs integrated with ChatGPTo. Instead of using traditional dialogue trees, these NPCs leverage AI-driven Agent Prompts to create more dynamic and engaging interactions.

### Open-Ended Input
Players can submit open-ended questions and responses to these characters, allowing for a more personalized and immersive experience. This setup enables players to ask questions about concepts they find challenging or simply have interesting conversations with the NPCs.

### Unique and Entertaining Responses
The AI-powered NPCs generate unique and entertaining responses, making each interaction fun and memorable. This approach not only enhances the gameplay experience but also provides an educational element, helping players better understand complex Web3 concepts through natural, conversational dialogue.


### Open-World Adventure
After completing the training levels, players enter an open-world blockchain-connected city featuring various DeFi and Web3 concepts, including:
- GameFi
- DAOs
- Yield farming
- NFTs

Players interact with unique characters and complete missions involving NPCs like the Commissioner.

### Advanced Web3 Integration
The game utilizes several advanced Web3 technologies to enhance the gameplay experience:
- **Chainlink Automation**: Automatically triggers ETH withdrawals to replenish the in-game faucet.
- **Chainlink Functions**: Verifies task completion and converts in-game tokens to ERC20 tokens.
- **Chainlink VRF**: Mints randomized graduation gifts for players reaching level 7.
- **Chainlink CCIP**: Facilitates complex transactions and token transfers across different blockchains.

## Technical Details

### Technologies and Tools Used
- **Web3JS**: Interacts with Ethereum RPCs on the client side.
- **Simple Web3 PHP Interface**: Creates in-game ETH faucets.
- **ImpactJS**: Pure vanilla JS game engine for building HTML5/JS games.
- **PixelLab**: AI-powered extension for Aseprite to create pixel-art sprite sheets.

## Future Plans

If the project is well-received, I plan to continue expanding the open-world adventure with new tasks and missions. The game content can grow alongside the evolving Web3 space, potentially incorporating sponsorships from Web3 companies to create branded training missions.

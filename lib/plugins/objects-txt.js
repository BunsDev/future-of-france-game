A password secures your wallet locally, preventing unauthorized local access but not affecting the blockchain account itself, which is secured by the private key. The private key, essential for blockchain actions like transferring funds, is generated from the seed phrase. Thus, anyone with the seed phrase can regenerate the account and use the private key. Remember: a password cannot restore wallet access if lostâ€”only the seed phrase or private key can. Therefore, securely backing up your seed phrase is vital.`,
